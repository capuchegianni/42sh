## 🧐 About <a name="about"></a>

<strong>From 7 may 2023 to 11 may 2023</strong>

The goal of this project was to recreate a terminal in C based on tcsh. Unlike previous Epitech projects, we were authorized to use the whole libc which allowed us to discover a plurality of new functions that we never heard of before or even other assiociated libs as `termios.h` in our project.

## 💻 Features <a name="features"></a>

We achieved to implement a lot of features in this project:
- The basics:
  - Command execution
  - Error handling
  - Return values
  - Separators (; && ||)
  - Redirections (only > and >>)
- The builtins:
  - Setenv
  - Unsetenv
  - Cd
  - Echo (our school wanted us to redo the command we don't know why)
  - Alias
  - Unalias
  - History
  - Exit
- Some add-ons:
  - Being able to navigate through the string with the left and right arrows
  - display the last command used with the up arrow, same on the other way with the down arrow
  - autocomplete the command when pressing tab and the string is not empty
  - display the current folder files when pressing tab
  - A personnalized prompt

## ➕ To be added <a name="more"></a>

- We still need to improve our shell with these few things:
  - Pipes
  - Left redirections (< and <<)
  - Globbings (\*, ? or !)
  - Improve our inhibitors (only detect basic characters as \n or \t for example)
  - Local variables

## 📆 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

This project was pretty fun to do, even if we were only three to work on it (instead of 4 or 5 persons). We got 52.8% at our final test with a crash but I already fixed them all. If you have any question about this project do not hesitate to contact me through my github account!
